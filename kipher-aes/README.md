# Module kipher-aes

Library for encrypting/decrypting data using AES encryption algorithm.

### What can you encrypt?

You can use AES encryption on the ff. (but not limited to):

- **Text**: AES can encrypt plain text, such as messages, passwords, or any other textual data.

- **Files**: AES can encrypt files of any type, including documents, images, videos, or any other
  file format.

- **Communication**: AES can be used to encrypt data transmitted over a network, such as emails,
  instant messages, or data exchanged between client and server.

> It's important to note that AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used
> for both encryption and decryption. Therefore, the security of the encrypted data relies heavily
> on the protection and management of the encryption key.
