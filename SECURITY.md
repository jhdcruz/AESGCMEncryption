# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**Only the latest version are supported.**

**There are currently no plans nor man-power to backport fixes to older versions**. If
you are using an older version, please upgrade to the latest version. Otherwise,
you are on your own.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

security tab.

**Reporting a vulnerability should at least include the following:**

- A description of the vulnerability
- How to reproduce the vulnerability/proof-of-concept (very important)
- Possible ways to fix/mitigate the vulnerability _(optional)_
